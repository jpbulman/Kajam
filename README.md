# Meeting Scheduler
The goal of this project is for a leader of an organization to be able to create a schedule where particpants in the group can sign up to meet with the leader. An organizer will create a schedule and then use a link to send out to their participants so they can sign up for a given time slot in the meetings available. This task was given to us to do over the course of B-term (just 7 weeks!) 2018-19 for Software Engineering, CS 3733.
