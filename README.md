# Meeting Scheduler
The goal of this project is for a leader of an organization to be able to create a schedule where particpants in the group can sign up to meet with the leader. An organizer will create a schedule and then use a link to send out to their participants so they can sign up for a given time slot in the meetings available. This task was given to us to do over the course of B-term (just 7 weeks!) 2018-19 for Software Engineering, CS 3733.

## Kajam
All the class teams were given team names at the start of the term, all of them being star names. Kajam is the first star in the Omega portion of the Hercules system. The word comes from the greek
*Caia*, in reference to the club of Hercules himself. [source](http://www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/Kajam.html)
