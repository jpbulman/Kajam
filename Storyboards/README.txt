----------------------
1. A textbox for a participant to enter a schedule ID. If a valid ID is given and the go button is pressed, the page will then be redirected to the corresponding participant view for the given schedule. If it is invalid, the box will be highlighted red and will have a small pop up saying 'Invalid ID'

2. A textbox for an organizer to enter their secret ID. If the organizer ID is valid and the go button is pressed, the page will be redirected to the corresponding organizer view for their schedule. If it is invalid, the box will be highlighted red and will have a small pop up saying 'Invalid ID' 

3. The 'Go' button can be clicked once one of the text fields is filled with an ID. If none or both of the fields are filled, then the button will be greyed out and unclickabel until the user fixes the inputs.

4. The 'Create A New Schedule' button allows a user to become an organizer and to create a schedule. This will redirect them to an organizer view with a blank schedule that they can start to fill in.
